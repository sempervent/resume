abstractNote = {The existing methodologies for gathering and computing zonal statistics from the combination of a raster image and a shapefile either require advanced programming knowledge in at least one language or the use of proprietary software such as ArcGIS. The software “Choppy Lite” offers several solutions for acquiring zonal statistics that can be used without proprietary software or programming knowledge. This software provides a Docker-based ecosystem, allowing users of any experience level to simply run a single line command in a terminal prompt independent of the operating system. Intermediate to advanced users can import the class provided by the software package into their own Python scripts.},

abstractNote = {The COVID-19 pandemic has made the dangers of the spread of misinformation obvious but despite much global effort to curbing its spread, fake information about the pandemic keeps proliferating. In this paper, we address the development of automated methods for verification of claims about COVID-19 and discuss the challenges associated with this task. We focus on labeled data collection, limitations of existing models, and difficulties of applying misinformation detection models in practical applications. Our initial analysis indicates label imbalance may be a particular challenge for developing claim verification models and we discuss options for alleviating this issue.},
